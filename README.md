## Description

This is a nice RPG game :D

You were someday walking into your home when SUDDENTLY a Truck runs over you.
Why happened that to you??? What was going to be in your generic life???
You only know that you have awakened on a medieval town that surrounds an enormous tower,
Why this place exists?? Who is in the tower?? Why all the inhabitant have lived the same experience???

Only you can discover that by exploring the tower.
